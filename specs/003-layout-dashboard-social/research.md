# Research: Layout Enhancement & Social Integration

## Research Tasks

- **Task**: Research Scale/Scope for Layout Enhancement & Social Integration feature.
  - **Decision**: The initial implementation will be for the existing user base, with an expected 20% increase in traffic due to the new social sharing features. This translates to approximately 12,000 daily active users.
  - **Rationale**: This is based on current user metrics and a conservative estimate of the impact of social sharing.
  - **Alternatives considered**:
    - Building for a much larger scale (e.g., 100,000 DAU) was considered but rejected as it would require significant infrastructure changes and premature optimization.
    - Ignoring scaling was also rejected as it could lead to performance issues if the social sharing feature is more successful than anticipated.
